📚 LLM-Powered Flashcard GeneratorA Streamlit application designed to automatically generate question-and-answer flashcards from various educational materials using Google's Gemini Large Language Models (LLMs). This tool provides a simple, intuitive interface for students and educators to quickly transform notes, textbook excerpts, or pasted text into effective study aids.✨ FeaturesContent Ingestion:Upload .pdf or .txt files directly.Paste raw text into a dedicated input area.Subject-Contextual Generation: Select a subject (e.g., Biology, History, Computer Science) to guide the LLM in generating more relevant and accurate flashcards.Automatic Flashcard Creation: Generates a minimum of 10-15 concise Q&A flashcards per input submission.Topic Grouping (Bonus): Flashcards are intelligently grouped under detected topic headers, enhancing organization and study flow.Interactive Display: View generated flashcards within a clean, tabular format in the Streamlit interface.Export Functionality: Easily download generated flashcards as a .csv file for use in other applications or for offline study.Robust Error Handling: Includes error messages for common API issues like model not found or quota limits.🛠️ SetupFollow these steps to get your LLM-Powered Flashcard Generator up and running on your local machine.PrerequisitesPython 3.8+pip (Python package installer)1. Clone the RepositoryFirst, clone the project from your GitHub repository:git clone https://github.com/shruti-01-narwat/Gemini_Flashcard.git
cd Gemini_Flashcard
2. Install DependenciesInstall all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Get Your Google Gemini API KeyTo use the Gemini LLMs, you need an API key from Google AI Studio.Access Google AI Studio:Open your web browser and go to https://ai.google.dev/aistudio.Sign in with your Google account. This should be the account you wish to use for developing with Google's AI services.Create an API Key:On the Google AI Studio interface, look for a prominent button or section labeled "Get API key" or "API keys." Click on it.A dialog box titled "Create API key" will appear, prompting you to "Select a project from your existing Google Cloud projects."Crucial Step: You must associate your API key with a Google Cloud Project.If you have an existing Google Cloud Project, select it from the dropdown.If you don't have one, or you prefer a new one for this project, choose the option to "Create new project" (this option might be integrated within the dropdown or as a separate link). Creating a new project often helps set up necessary configurations automatically. If you see a project named something like Gemini API gen-lang-client-XXXXXXXXXX (similar to what was in your screenshot), select that project as it's likely set up for Gemini API use.Confirm your selection, and your API key will be generated.Immediately copy the entire API key. Store it securely. Never commit your API key directly into public GitHub repositories.4. Enable Generative Language API in Google CloudEven after getting an API key, the underlying API must be enabled for the Google Cloud Project it's linked to. This is a common cause of the "404 models/gemini-pro is not found" error.Go to Google Cloud Console:Open https://console.cloud.google.com/.Ensure you are signed in with the same Google account and have selected the exact same Google Cloud Project that you associated with your API key in Google AI Studio. You can select the project using the dropdown menu at the top of the console.Navigate to APIs & Services:In the left-hand navigation menu, click on "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & Services".Enable the API:Click the "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button at the top.In the search bar, type "Generative Language API" and press Enter.Click on the "Generative Language API" search result.If it's not already enabled, click the "ENABLE" button. Wait a few moments for it to activate.5. Configure Your Project with the API Key and Correct ModelOpen main.py and replace the placeholder API key with your actual key and set the correct model name.Locate this section:# API setup
# Paste API key is placed directly here.
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE") # Replace this!

# Corrected model name based on your genai.list_models() output
# You can choose another model from your list if preferred, e.g., "models/gemini-2.5-pro"
model = genai.GenerativeModel("models/gemini-1.5-pro") # Use the exact model name from your API access
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE" with the API key you copied from Google AI Studio.Model Name: Based on our previous troubleshooting, models/gemini-1.5-pro is a good choice, but you can use any model name returned by genai.list_models() that supports generateContent, such as models/gemini-2.5-pro, models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest, or models/gemini-1.5-flash.🚀 Run the ApplicationOnce everything is set up, run the Streamlit application from your terminal:streamlit run main.py
This will open the application in your default web browser.📂 Project StructureGemini_Flashcard/

💡 Troubleshooting Common Issues404 models/gemini-pro is not found:Cause: The model name specified in main.py is not accessible with your API key, or the Generative Language API is not enabled for your Google Cloud Project.Solution:Verify the API key creation process (Step 3 in Setup).Crucially, ensure the "Generative Language API" is ENABLED for your Google Cloud Project (Step 4 in Setup).Run a small script to list available models:import google.generativeai as genai
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
for m in genai.list_models():
    if "generateContent" in m.supported_generation_methods:
        print(f"- {m.name}")
Then, update the model = genai.GenerativeModel(...) line in main.py with the exact model name returned (e.g., models/gemini-1.5-pro).429 You exceeded your current quota:Cause: You've made too many API requests within a short period, or your Google Cloud Project's free tier quota has been exceeded.Solution:Wait: Often, this is a temporary rate limit that resets after a few minutes or an hour.Check Billing: Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing in your Google Cloud Console (ensuring the correct project is selected). You may need to link a billing account to your project to increase your quota for higher usage.Check Quotas: In Google Cloud Console, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Quotas" and search for "Generative Language API" to review your limits. You can request increases there if needed.🤝 ContributionFeel free to fork this repository, open issues, or submit pull requests to improve the project!Developed as an internship assignment demonstrating LLM integration.
